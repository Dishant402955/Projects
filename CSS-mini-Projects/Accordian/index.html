                    JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of
                    the World Wide Web,
                    alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page
                    behavior, often
                    incorporating third-party libraries.
